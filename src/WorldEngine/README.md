# WorldEngine

When I named this, I did not remember the machine from Superman, [World Engine](https://dccomicsextendeduniverse.fandom.com/wiki/World_Engine), that terraformed planets. I just thought it was a funny name for an engine that would never truly be capable of rendering large scenes. After all, this is a [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) game engine. Down the line I want to heavily comment everything to generate a documentation website.

## Sample Uses
